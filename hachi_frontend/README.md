# About:
This directory contains client-side logic for `hachi` .

## Development:
1. ``npm install``   command would install necessary npm dependencies.
2. Once frontend code is updated/modified, ``npm run build`` command would generate ``static`` (html/js/css)  files for the front-end into the ``../static/`` folder.
